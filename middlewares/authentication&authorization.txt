//                       Difference between authentication and authorization

AUTHENTICATION:
simple means of authentication is authenticate any user (login the user), they knows that the particular user 
is belongs to particular application.

Example: When a user logs in to a website with their credentials (e.g., username and password), the system verifies
the credentials and authenticates the user. Once authenticated, the system knows that the user is legitimate.



AUTHORIZATION:
authorization means check the user if it is authorized to particular application or not.
for eg: if you want anywhere like you want to go inside a club and you have a membership of that then you are 
able to go inside it then it means you are authenticated to it but there are certain places (like:kitchen of that club)
where only admins are able to go then we can say that admins are authorized to thier particular place 

Example: After logging into a system (authentication), you may be allowed to access your personal account or view certain 
pages, but there could be restricted areas that only specific users (e.g., admins) can access. This permission to access 
certain resources is authorization.

Real-Life Example: You are authenticated to enter a club based on your membership (authentication). However, authorization
determines whether you can access specific areas, like the VIP lounge or kitchen. Only authorized users (e.g., club admins 
or staff) have permission to enter restricted areas.
