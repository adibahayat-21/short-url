//                                      TOKENS 

here we see that how token is created:
there is a user and client so suppose user is entering thier password and username then this detail goes to the 
server then server will check to the database that if there any username or password exist or it is correct
if it is exist or correct then the server will make token of it which contains all the details like:
there id, name, and email.so the token is created and the main thing is that server have to send this token 
to the client in secure way.

so there are two ways to send this token in secure way which is:
-> through cookies                ->through response 


->through cookies 

so when the server use cookies to send the token then the server created a cookie which contains the token
(that is created earlier which have to send to the client) and the uid. so this cookie is send to the client
and then the browser save this cookie becuse it is a default behaviour of browser to save cookie.

now whenever the user want to send any request then this cookie will automatically go along with them.
suppose the user is requesting then cookie is going along with them then the server will check the cookie
and take the token from it to check that if that cookie contains the uid or not if the uid is not present then
it means the user is logged out and if the uid is present then it will check the whole details from the token 
if the detail is matched from the details that it have (because the detail is provided by the server itself initially
at the time of making token) after matching the details then the server will be able to identify that the 
request is coming from which user.


Main thing:
Cookie is domain specific it means-
suppose there is a user who is logging to facebook and it goes to facebook website then the facebook will make
cookie for that user and let's assume facebook is making 2 cookies for user.
and then the user will go to another website like wikipedia then wikipedia will send another 2 cookie for that 
user then whenever user want to go to that particular site then only that cookie is used which is send by that
particular website. means when user again logging to the facebook then only that 2 cookie is used which is send 
by facebook and when user go to wikipedia website then only that cookie is used which is sent by wikipedia.
this shows the concept that cookie is domain specific.
