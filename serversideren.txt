//                            SERVER SIDE RENDERING

server side rendering means that our html page or web page is rendered by server for eg: we write like this 
app.get("test",(req,res)=>{
    return res.end("<h1>Hey from server</h1>");
})

so when we write this above line in our file anbd then we open localhost in browser then we find that web page
it is written hey from server.
